# Hello World! My name is Lauren Bassett, I am a Computer Scientist and Economist and lifelong learner. My technical and academic passions include cyber security, data semantics, and networks. I expect to graduate in December of 2020 with a B.S. of Engineering in Computer Science and a B.S. in Business Economics, as well as minors in Mathematics and Statistics, and the Undergraduate Certificate in Cyber Security. I am active on campus in both social and educational groups. I am a Peer Tutor in the Gatton College of Business and Economics for Economic Statistics, Microeconomics, and Macroeconomics. I am also involved in both the Society for Women Engineers and the Women in Economics Club, which I helped to start. I have assisted the Formula Racing Team writing Arduino Code for their gear shift. Socially, I am a member of Alpha Delta Pi Sorority, where I served as the Director of Alumnae Engagement.
